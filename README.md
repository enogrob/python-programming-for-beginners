**Overview**

This course includes over 26 lectures and almost 4 hours of content, designed specifically for Python programming beginners.

You will be guided through the installation process and the basic concepts of Python programming, getting to grips with the language as a whole. From there, you'll dive straight into the specifics, learning the variables, loops and statements of the language and getting to grips with the function parameters, variables and common errors.

During this course you'll have the opportunity to put your knowledge to practical use by working with files and classes, importing syntax and making modules, and most importantly, by building your own Python program from scratch.

You'll walk away with detailed knowledge of one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. You'll have gained a foundation of skills that will enable you to progress to more complex coding languages, as well as understanding the underlying principles of all programming languages. In short, you'll have everything you need to become a proficient programmer.
